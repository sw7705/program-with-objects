        HTML documents contain <em>text
          content</em> which describes "what you see" and
        <em>markup</em> which describes "how it looks". Reference type material could be documents, images, or videos.

    <h2>Webpage</h2>
      A web page is a text document written in a language called HTML. Web browsers read these documents, and then interpret and display them.
      <p>
        Coding happens when programmers write text in a language that a computer can understand. The computer can then follow the instructions the programmer wrote.
      </p>
      <p>Programmers need to write exactly the way a computer understands (also known as writing with correct "syntax"). </p>
      <p>There are too many details to keep everything in your head. If you forget how to make text italic in HTML, you can always just look it up. </p>
      <p><b>Basic HTML Vocabulary</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Tag: An HTML tag is always contained within angled brackets. Most tags have an opening tag and a closing tag. Some tags (called "void" tags) do not require a closing tag.</li>
        <li>Element: An HTML element refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags.</li>
        <li>Attribute: This is a property of an HTML element. For example, to set the href attribute of an anchor tag to the Udacity URL, you would write "a href="www.udacity.com""</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Inline vs Block Elements</P>

      <p>HTML elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>. Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them.</p>
      <h3><a href="#top">TOP</a></h3>

  <div class="components" id="st-1_topic-1-4">
    <h2>DOM</h2>
      <p><b>Document Object Model</b></p>
      <p>The "tree-like structure" comes from the fact that HTML elements can have other elements inside of them.</p>
      <p>
        In a browser, this structure shows up as a series of nested boxes. There are boxes inside of boxes inside of boxes, and so on...
      </p>
      <p>Document Object Model - a cross-platform and language-independent convention for representing and interacting with objects in HTML (and other markup languages). The nodes of every document are organized in a tree structure, called the DOM tree.</p>
      <p>
        When you read an HTML document as
        <em>text</em>, you see a wave of changing indentations going up and down the left side of the document. The more indented an element is, the more deeply nested its corresponding "box" is.

    <h2>Text Editors for Programming</h2>
      <p>
        When writing code, programmers use special text editors (like Sublime Text for example). These editors make the programmer's life easier. For example, some text editors will automatically generate a closing HTML tag when you write an opening tag.

    <h2>CSS</h2>
      <p>
        Avoiding repetition is important for a variety of reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Avoiding Errors:</b> When programmers <em>don't</em> avoid repetition, they will often have to do the same thing over and over. This may mean copy and pasting certain style attributes into many HTML elements or rewriting the same code (sometimes
        with minor differences) many times. This can lead to errors when the programmer decides to make a change to something. If they don't dilligently make that same change everywhere the repeated code appears, problems will arise.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Consistency:</b> In this web page, I wanted every lesson to look the same. Instead of manually giving each one the same style, I was able to assign each lesson <span class="code">div</span> the same <span class="code">class</span> and then
        specify the style for that class in only one place! By avoiding repetition, it's now very easy for me to make changes to this style.
      </p>
      <p>
        CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and they give programmers a way to control the style of related HTML elements. This is done by giving similar HTML elements the same <span class="code">class</span> name and then specifying the style that
        should apply to that class.

    <h2>Terms</h2>
      <p>
        <b>Computer:</b> A computer is a general-purpose device that can be programmed to carry out a set of arithmetic or logical operations automatically. Since a sequence of operations can be readily changed, the computer can solve more than one kind
        of problem. Computers are different. A computer can be programmed to do anything we want, as long as we can write a program that specifies a specific sequence of instructions.
      </p>
      <p> A computer program is a list of instructions that tell a computer what to do. Everything a computer does is done by using a computer program. Some examples of computer programs: A web browser like Mozilla Firefox and Apple Safari can be used to
        view web pages on the Internet.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Programming Language:</b> Python is a programming language. When you write Python code and press "Run", a Python Interpreter converts the code you wrote as a set of instructions that the computer itself can understand and execute.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Python:</b> Python is a programming language. When you write Python code and press "Run", a Python Interpreter converts the code you wrote as a set of instructions that the computer itself can understand and execute.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Grammar</b>(syntax)<b>:</b> In linguistics, syntax is the set of rules, principles, and processes that govern the structure of sentences in a given language. Python Expressions follow a specific Syntax.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Expression:</b> A Python "expression" is a legal Python statement. For example: print 1 + 1 is a valid expression, but print 1 + (without a number at the end) is not.

    <h2>Variables and Assignment</h2>
      <p>
        <b>Names:</b> A name in Python can be any sequence of letters, numbers, and underscores (_) that does not start with a number. We usually use all lowercase letters for variable names, but capitalization must match exactly.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Variable:</b> A variable is something that holds a value that may change. In simplest terms, a variable is just a box that you can put stuff in. You can use variables to store all kinds of stuff, including numbers and words.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Assignment Statement:</b> An assignment statement assigns a value to a variable: <span class="code">name</span> = <span class="code">expression</span>
      </p>
      <p>After the assignment statement, the variable <span class="code">name</span> refers to the value of the <span class="code">expression</span> on the right side of the assignment. An <span class="code">expression</span> is any Python construct that
        has a value.
      </p>
      <p>Python allows the left hand side of an assignment to have more than one name separated by commas. For example, a, b = c, d - assigns the value of c to a and the value of d to b. (What's really going on here is that list of values are packaged into
        a tuple, and a tuple is separated when multiple names are on the left side of an assignment.)

    <h2>Strings</h2>
      <p>
        <b>String:</b> A string is a sequence of characters surrounded by quotes. The quotes can be either single or double quotes, but the quotes at both ends of the string must be the same type. Here are some examples of strings in Python:
        <p>"silly"
        </p>
        <P>'string'
        </p>
        <P>"I'm a valid string, even with a single quote in the middle!"
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Indexing Strings:</b> The indexing operator provides a way to extract subsequences of characters from a string.
        </p>
        <p><b>String Indexing: </b><span class="code">string[number] = string</span> </p>
        <p>Outputs a single-character string containing the character at position <span class="code">number</span> of the input <span class="code">string</span>. Positions in the string are counted starting from 0, so s[1] outputs the second character in
          s. If the <span class="code">number</span> is negative, positions are counted from the end of the string: s[-1] produces the last character in s.
        </p>
        <p><b>String Extraction: </b><span class="code">string[start number:stop number] = string</span>
        </p>
        <p>Outputs a string that is the subsequence of the input string starting from position <span class="code">stop number</span>. If <span class="code">start number</span> is missing, starts from the beginning of the input string; if <span class="code">stop number</span>          is missing, the output extends to the end of the input string.

    <h2>Debugging</h2>
      <p>
        <b>Debugging Strategy:</b> 5 debugging strategies to follow.
        <ul>
          <li>1. Examine error messages when the programs crash - The last line of Python Tracebacks will tell you what went wrong. Reading backwards from there will tell you more about where the problem occurred.</li>
          <li>2. Work from example code - If your modified code doesn't work, comment it out and do step-by-step modifications to the example code until does what you want.</li>
          <li>3. Make sure examples work - Just becuase you find example code doesn't mean it will work in your system. Check the example code you're using to make sure it behaves the way you expect.
          </li>
          <li>4. Check (print) intermediate results - When your code doesn't crash, but doesn't behave as expected, add print statements to your program to see where in the code things stop behaving correctly.
          </li>
          <li>5. Keep and compare old versions - When you have a working version of your code, save it before you add to the code. This will give you something to go back to if you introduce too many bugs.
          </li>

    <h2>Functions</h2>
      <p><b>Function:</b> A series of statements which returns some value to a caller. It can also be passed zero or more arguments which may be used in the execution of the body.
      </p>
      <p>We use the<span class="code"> def</span> function to let python know we are declaring a function definition - short for "I'm <b>DEF</b>ining a function here"
      </p>
      <p>We use the<span class="code"> return</span> statement to "return" from a function i.e. break out of the function. We can optionally return a value from the function as well.

    <h2>Control Flow and Loops</h2>
      <p>
        <b>Control Flow</b>
        <p>Execution always begins at the first statement of the program. Statements are executed one at a time, in order from top to bottom.
        </p>
        <p>Function definitions do not alter the flow of execution of the program, but remember that statements inside the function are not executed until the function is called.
        </p>
        <p>Although it is not common, you can define one function inside another. In this case, the inner definition isn’t executed until the outer function is called.
        </p>
        <p>Function calls are like a detour in the flow of execution. Instead of going to the next statement, the flow jumps to the first line of the called function, executes all the statements there, and then comes back to pick up where it left off.
        <p>That sounds simple enough, until you remember that one function can call another. While in the middle of one function, the program might have to execute the statements in another function. But while executing that new function, the program might
            have to execute yet another function!
        </p>
        <b>Loops</b>
        <p><span class="code"> For</span> Loops are traditionally used when you have a piece of code which you want to repeat <span class="code"> n</span> number of times.
        <p>As an alternative, a <span class="code"> while</span> Loop, is used when a condition is to be met, or quite possibly if you are not careful will cause a piece of code to repeat forever.

    <h2>Object Oriented Programming</h2>
      <p>My notes sort of go all over the place as this chapter was thought provoking in many ways. Between the examples in the lesson for thinking of abstract ways to apply what we have learned, I found myself jumping all over. I also included a story to help me understand how a message input will deliver a result without necessarily being aware of all the processes in the middle. 
      </p>
      <p>Object Oriented programming (OOP) in my mind is an approach that scales very well, from the most trivial of problems to the most complex tasks. In a nutshell, OOP provides a form of abstraction that resonates with techniques people use to solve problems in everyday life. In the lesson and in my notes real life examples were given to illustrate the concept. The very first lesson involved writing some code that would play a video every two hours to remind us to take a break. OOP was utilized to break the problem and coding down into little bite size pieces and steps to accomplish our overall end result. It also establish a relationship between the various objects. 
      </P>
      <p>Several thought provoking examples for OOP distill into a couple major principles. (I did a lot of extra reading from a number of resources to grasp these principles)
      </P>
      <p>Encapsulation
      </p>
      <p>Encapsulation is the hiding of data implementation by restricting access to accessors and mutators. 
      </p>
      <p>Accessors are a method that is used to ask an object about itself. These are usually in the form of properties, which have, under normal conditions, a "get" method. However, accessor methods are not restricted to properties and can be any pubic method that gives information about the state of the object. 
      </p>
      <p>Mutators are public methods that are used to modify the state of an object, while hiding the implementation of exactly how the date gets modified.
      </p>
      <p>Abstraction
      </p>
      <p>Abstraction denotes the essential characteristics of an object that distinguish it from all other kinds of objects and thus provide defined conceptual boundaries, relative to the viewer.
      </p>
      <p>Inheritance
      </p>
      <p>Inheritance describes how objects can relate to each other and can be treated the same though they are not identical. Parent to child relationship.
      </p>
      <p>Polymorphism
      </p>
      <p>Polymorphism means "one name", "many forms". Polymorphism manifests itself by having multiple methods all with the same name, but with slightly different functionality. There are 2 basic types of polymorphism. Overriding, also called run-time polymorphism, and Overloading, which is referred to as compile-time polymorphism. The difference is, for method overloading, the compiler determines which method will be executed, and this decision is made when the code gets compiled. Which method will be used for method overriding is determined at runtime based on the dynamic type of an object.

    <h2>OOP Real World Story/Example</h2>
      <p>A story or real world example that I researched helped me understand alot of the concepts and definitions as well as examples of objects, classes, methods, variables, and inheritance. Suppose an individual named Chris wishes to send flowers to a friend named Robin, who lives in another city. Because of the distance, Chris cannot simply pick the flowers and take them to Robin in person. Nevertheless, it is a task that is easily solved. Chris simply walks to a nearby flower shop, run by a florist named Fred. Chris will tell Fred the kinds of flowers to send to Robin, and the address to which they should be delivered. Chris can then be assured that the flowers will be delivered expediently and automatically. 
      </p>
      <p>Let us emphasize that the mechanism that was used to solve this problem was to find an appropriate agent (namely, Fred) and to pass to this agent a message containing a request. It is the responsibility of Fred to satisfy the request. There is some method (some algorithm or set of operations) used by Fred to do this. Chris does not need to know the particular method that Fred will use to satisfy the request abstraction; indeed, often the person making a request does not want to know the details. This information is usually hidden from inspection. 
      </p>
      <p>An investigation, however, might uncover the fact that Fred delivers a slightly different message to another florist in the city where Robin lives. That florist, in return, perhaps has a subordinate who makes the flower arrangement. The florist then passes the flowers, along with yet another message, to a delivery person, and so on. Earlier, the florist in Robin's city had obtained her flowers from a flower wholesaler who, in turn, had interactions with the flower growers, each of whom had to manage a team of gardeners.So, our first observation of object-oriented problem solving is that the solution to this problem required the help of many other individuals. Without their help, the problem could not be easily solved. We phrase this in a general fashion as the following: An object oriented program is structured as a community of interacting agents, called objects. Each object has a role to play. Each object provides a service, or performs an action, that is used by other members of the community.
      </P>
      <p>The chain reaction that ultimately resulted in the solution to Chris's problem began with a request given to the florist Fred. This request lead to other requests, which lead to still more requests, until the flowers ultimately reached Chris's friend Robin. We see, therefore, that members of this community interact with each other by making requests. So, our next principle of object-oriented problem solving is the vehicle used to indicate an action to be performed: Action is initiated in object-oriented programming by the transmission of a message to an agent (an object) responsible for the action. The message encodes the request for an action and is accompanied by any additional information (arguments) needed to carry out the request. The receiver is the object to whom the message is sent. If the receiver accepts the message, it accepts the responsibility to carry out the indicated action. In response to a message, the receiver will perform some method to satisfy the request.We have noted the important principle of information hiding in regard to message passing that is, the client sending the request need not know the actual means by which the request will be honored. There is another principle, all too human, that we see is implicit in message passing. If there is a task to perform, the first thought of the client is to find somebody else he or she can ask to do the work. This second reaction often becomes atrophied in many programmers with extensive experience in conventional techniques. Frequently, a difficult hurdle to overcome is the idea in the programmer's mind that he or she must write everything and not use the services of others. An important part of object-oriented programming is the development of reusable components, and an important first step in the use of reusable components is a willingness to trust software written by others.

    <h2>Messages versus Procedure Calls</h2>
      <p>Information hiding is also an important aspect of programming in conventional languages. In what sense is a message different from, say, a procedure call? In both cases, there is a set of well-defined steps that will be initiated following the request. But, there are two important distinctions. The first is that in a message there is a designated receiver for that message; the receiver is some object to which the message is sent. In a procedure call, there is no designated receiver. The second is that the interpretation of the message (that is, the method used to respond to the message) is determined by the receiver and can vary with different receivers. Chris could give a message to a friend named Elizabeth, for example, and she will understand it and a satisfactory outcome will be produced (that is, flowers will be delivered to their mutual friend Robin). However, the method Elizabeth uses to satisfy the request (in all likelihood, simply passing the request on to Fred) will be different from that used by Fred in response to the same request.There, the distinction between message passing and procedure calling is that, in message passing, there is a designated receiver, and the interpretation the selection of a method to execute in response to the message may vary with different receivers. Usually, the specific receiver for any given message will not be known until run time, so the determination of which method to invoke cannot be made until then. Thus, we say there is late binding between the message (function or procedure name) and the code fragment (method) used to respond to the message. This situation is in contrast to the very early (compile-time or link-time) binding of name to code fragment in conventional procedure calls.

         <li>1. Everything is an object.</li>
         <li>2. Computation is performed by objects communicating with each other, requesting that other objects perform actions. Objects communicate by sending and receiving messages. A message is a request for action bundled with whatever arguments may be necessary to complete the task.</li>
         <li>3. Each object has its own memory, which consists of other objects.</li>
         <li>4. Every object is an instance of a class. A class simply represents a grouping of similar objects, such as integers or lists.</li>
         <li>5. The class is the repository for behavior associated with an object. That is, all objects that are instances of the same class can perform the same actions.</li>
         <li>6. Classes are organized into a singly rooted tree structure, called the inheritance hierarchy. Memory and behavior associated with instances of a class are automatically available to any class associated with a descendant in this tree structure.</li>

    <h2>Extra thoughts</h2>
      <p>I am way down in my notes and this just hit me. Object Oriented Programming as it relates to HTML and CSS should avoid unnecessary repetition. CSS for example, rather than having each CSS element contain their own unique style with several overlapping and repeating qualities I need to apply a little planning and forethought and use classes. With less code and more reusability or perhaps inheritance applied for most of the CSS styling in my HTML, I can accomplish more with less.  HTML = Structure, CSS = Style.
